Scripts were used to download and proccess the data. The sourcecode can be found within the same folder as this file
They were run in the following order:

1. MarmalAidChamp.R (ran on GenomeDK cluster)
2. betaCount.R (ran on GenomeDK cluster)
3. savePartsMini.R (ran on GenomeDK cluster)

-----------------------


Additionally, all samples included in MarmalAid were run through ChAMP by the following two scripts on GenomeDK cluster:
RunChAMPProcess.sh
ChAMPProcess.R

The results can be found in:
O:\HE_MOMA-Data\MICROARRAY\Prostata\450K MarmalAid\resultsChamp




-------------------------------
All betavalues can be found in:
O:\HE_MOMA-Data\MICROARRAY\Prostata\450K_MarmalAid\ProcessedData\betavalues

There is one file for each of the 485511 probes
They were constructed from running:
saveindu.R (ran on GenomeDK cluster)
